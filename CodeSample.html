          <div class="mb-3">
            Lootchadors is a party beat 'em up multiplayer game being developed
            in UE4. The aim of the game is to loot fun environments and finish
            the match with the most money. You can throw, punch, dash and use
            power ups on each other to cause mayhem! Lootchadors is Saturday
            Morning Cartoons meets Pro Wrestling mixed with Slapstick Humour!

            An example of the Oil Slip Stat Effect and the Fully Stunned Stat

          </div>


          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mt-3">The Problem</h2>
          <div class="mb-3">
            While making Lootchadors I realised we needed a system to handle
            combat interactions and power up effects between players. An example
            of the types effects this system should cover are being hit by
            another player, being stunned by another player and slipping on an
            oil slick. The idea would be to create a system which allows both
            visual effects and gameplay effects/restraints to be added to
            players in a simple way with scope for allowing Designers control
            over these effects.
          </div>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mt-3">The Solution</h2>
          The solution I came up with for this was a Stat Effect system. This
          system would both handle the visual and gameplay parts of stat
          effects. <br />
          The different parts that make up this system are;

          <ul>
            <li>
              Stat Effect manager which handles adding, queuing and removing
              Stat Effects from the players.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stat Effect which is a container for the visual and gameplay
              effects that are added to the player. (GameplayCFG and VisualCFG)
            </li>
            <li>
              Stat Effects Gameplay Tags, tags which are used to drive gameplay.
              The tags are added to the player and can effect the players
              current state or anim state.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stat Effects Visual, VFX, Sounds, Particle Systems, UI and
              animations that are added and removed from the player
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mt-3">Technical Breakdown</h2>
          The two core components of a Stat Effect are the GameplayCFG and
          VisualCFG.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Gameplay CFG contains the type of Stat Effect such as whether its
              visual or also effects gameplay, Has a Gameplay Tags container
              which is part of unreal engine, The players state machine will
              check for certain tags and enter specific gameplay states if those
              tags are met. For example if a player is hit with a 3 strike combo
              it adds the Fully Stunned Stat Effect which adds a tag
              (Player.StatEffect.FullyStunned) which when found by the players
              state machine puts them into a stunned state where they can’t
              move. The gameplay CFG also contains a enum for the type of kill
              condition for a Stat Effect. Some might be time based, some might
              be specific conditions met in Blueprint or some might only be for
              one frame.
            </li>
            <li>
              Visual CFG The visual CFG is used to contain visual such as VFX,
              Level Sequences, Sounds and animations to play. The visual CFG is
              purely for cosmetics and doesn’t effect the players state. It
              works more as an overlay.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          There’s a Data Table which has a list of StatEffect configs. This
          gives a central location for all Stat Effects and an easy way to
          create Stat Effects from the configs.
          <br /><br />
          An example of the flow of a Stat Effect being applied:
          <br /><br />
          There’s an Oil Slick placed on the floor. A player collides with it.
          The Player detects the collision and queries the Oil Slick power up
          for its Stat Effect. The Oil Slick passes a ref to the table handle of
          the Stat Effect, the players Stat Effect Manager then adds the Stat
          Effect to the player which because it has a sliding Gameplay Tag
          (Player.StatEffect.Sliding) makes the players state machine switch to
          the sliding state which adds a velocity to the player in their forward
          vector. The visual part of the Stat Effect is added which is Oil
          Droplets dripping off (Particle System) and the player plays a sliding
          animation. This Stat Effect has some custom logic for its end
          condition which is colliding with a wall which is done in blueprint
          and notifies the Stat Effect Manager that the effect is to be killed
          but otherwise Stat Effects typically only last a frame or duration and
          are handled by the manager. Once the effect is finished/marked for
          kill the Stat Effect manager will check if the Stat Effect is in the
          currently active Stat Effects list and remove it or if it’s a
          stackable Stat Effect remove 1 from the count.
          <br /><br />
          That’s pretty much the workflow. The driving force of the stat effects
          are the Gameplay Tags. The player has a container of these and every
          frame the state machine reads them and changes its state based on
          certain tags.
          <br /><br />
